_A simple dice game using DOM Manipulation - modified code from a lesson in [Udemy - The Complete 2020 Web Development Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/share/101qYwAEEYeVpVTXgB/)_

**Click on the 'Roll' button to roll the dice**


Using JavaScript and DOM Manipulation the program creates four random numbers and associates them with a corresponding dice image to display on screen. Adding the dice to determine each user's total, the app uses Else If statements to display the winner (or draw) at the top of the page.
